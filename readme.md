# Infinite website
An infinite website, all urls exist.

## Setup
Run text-generation-webui with the --api flag.
Run main.py in an environment with the packages from requirements.txt installed.

## Useful info
If the url is for example "http://127.0.0.1:9898/shop.html", and you want it to reload, without deleting the file from pages manually, go to "http://127.0.0.1:9898/shop.html?new=true"
